**ABSTRACT**

The project presents a unique approach to campus navigation by using Dijkstra's algorithm, which is known for its effectiveness in determining the shortest path between points in a graph. With so many roads criss-crossing campus, it's important to plan your trip and determine the most convenient route to save time and energy for students, faculty, and visitors. At the heart of this project is Dijkstra's algorithm, the basis of graph theory, which makes it easy to calculate the shortest path or the distance between points. Using this algorithm, the navigation system efficiently calculates the optimal route between two locations on campus. Through careful planning and implementation, this project aims to improve campus access and accelerate tourism for its residents. 

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

In navigating daily campus life, individuals encounter challenges in determining the most efficient routes to their destinations. While various methods are attempted, not all yield optimal results. New students, in particular, experience discomfort navigating unfamiliar campus terrain. Thus, there is a pressing need for a navigation system to provide the most suitable routes within the campus environment.

**PROPOSED SOLUTION**

Our project, "Campus Navigation," aims to enhance the campus navigation experience by implementing Dijkstra's algorithm within a closed navigation system. By calculating the most efficient routes between any two points on the campus map, we seek to minimize travel time and energy consumption for users. Through innovative technology and continuous improvement, our goal is to provide a seamless and satisfying navigation experience for students, faculty, and visitors.
